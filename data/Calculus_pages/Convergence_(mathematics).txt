In mathematics normal convergence is a type of convergence for series of functions.  Like absolute-convergence, it has the useful property that it is preserved when the order of summation is changed.


== History ==
The concept of normal convergence was first introduced by René Baire in 1908 in his book Leçons sur les théories générales de l'analyse.


== Definition ==
Given a set S and functions 
  
    
      
        
          f
          
            n
          
        
        :
        S
        →
        
          C
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle f_{n}:S\to \mathbb {C} }
   (or to any normed vector space), the series

  
    
      
        
          ∑
          
            n
            =
            0
          
          
            ∞
          
        
        
          f
          
            n
          
        
        (
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \sum _{n=0}^{\infty }f_{n}(x)}
  is called normally convergent if the series of uniform norms of the terms of the series converges, i.e.,

  
    
      
        
          ∑
          
            n
            =
            0
          
          
            ∞
          
        
        ‖
        
          f
          
            n
          
        
        ‖
        :=
        
          ∑
          
            n
            =
            0
          
          
            ∞
          
        
        
          sup
          
            S
          
        
        
          |
        
        
          f
          
            n
          
        
        (
        x
        )
        
          |
        
        <
        ∞
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \sum _{n=0}^{\infty }\|f_{n}\|:=\sum _{n=0}^{\infty }\sup _{S}|f_{n}(x)|<\infty .}
  


== Distinctions ==
Normal convergence implies, but should not be confused with, uniform absolute convergence, i.e. uniform convergence of the series of nonnegative functions 
  
    
      
        
          ∑
          
            n
            =
            0
          
          
            ∞
          
        
        
          |
        
        
          f
          
            n
          
        
        (
        x
        )
        
          |
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \sum _{n=0}^{\infty }|f_{n}(x)|}
  .  To illustrate this, consider

  
    
      
        
          f
          
            n
          
        
        (
        x
        )
        =
        
          
            {
            
              
                
                  1
                  
                    /
                  
                  n
                  ,
                
                
                  x
                  =
                  n
                  ,
                
              
              
                
                  0
                  ,
                
                
                  x
                  ≠
                  n
                  .
                
              
            
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle f_{n}(x)={\begin{cases}1/n,&x=n,\\0,&x\neq n.\end{cases}}}
  Then the series 
  
    
      
        
          ∑
          
            n
            =
            0
          
          
            ∞
          
        
        
          |
        
        
          f
          
            n
          
        
        (
        x
        )
        
          |
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \sum _{n=0}^{\infty }|f_{n}(x)|}
   is uniformly convergent (for any ε take n ≥ 1/ε), but the series of uniform norms is the harmonic series and thus diverges.  An example using continuous functions can be made by replacing these functions with bump functions of height 1/n and width 1 centered at each natural number n.
As well, normal convergence of a series is different from norm-topology convergence, i.e. convergence of the partial sum sequence in the topology induced by the uniform norm.  Normal convergence implies norm-topology convergence if and only if the space of functions under consideration is complete with respect to the uniform norm.  (The converse does not hold even for complete function spaces: for example, consider the harmonic series as a sequence of constant functions).


== Generalizations ==


=== Local normal convergence ===
A series can be called "locally normally convergent on X" if each point x in X has a neighborhood U such that the series of functions ƒn restricted to the domain U

  
    
      
        
          ∑
          
            n
            =
            0
          
          
            ∞
          
        
        
          f
          
            n
          
        
        
          ∣
          
            U
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \sum _{n=0}^{\infty }f_{n}\mid _{U}}
  is normally convergent, i.e. such that

  
    
      
        
          ∑
          
            n
            =
            0
          
          
            ∞
          
        
        ‖
        
          f
          
            n
          
        
        
          ‖
          
            U
          
        
        <
        ∞
      
    
    {\displaystyle \sum _{n=0}^{\infty }\|f_{n}\|_{U}<\infty }
  where the norm 
  
    
      
        ‖
        ⋅
        
          ‖
          
            U
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \|\cdot \|_{U}}
   is the supremum over the domain U.


=== Compact normal convergence ===
A series is said to be "normally convergent on compact subsets of X" or "compactly normally convergent on X" if for every compact subset K of X, the series of functions ƒn restricted to K

  
    
      
        
          ∑
          
            n
            =
            0
          
          
            ∞
          
        
        
          f
          
            n
          
        
        
          ∣
          
            K
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \sum _{n=0}^{\infty }f_{n}\mid _{K}}
  is normally convergent on K.
Note: if X is locally compact (even in the weakest sense), local normal convergence and compact normal convergence are equivalent.


== Properties ==
Every normal convergent series is uniformly convergent, locally uniformly convergent, and compactly uniformly convergent. This is very important, since it assures that any re-arrangement of the series, any derivatives or integrals of the series, and sums and products with other convergent series will converge to the "correct" value.
If 
  
    
      
        
          ∑
          
            n
            =
            0
          
          
            ∞
          
        
        
          f
          
            n
          
        
        (
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \sum _{n=0}^{\infty }f_{n}(x)}
   is normally convergent to 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
  , then any re-arrangement of the sequence (ƒ1, ƒ2, ƒ3 ...) also converges normally to the same ƒ. That is, for every bijection 
  
    
      
        τ
        :
        
          N
        
        →
        
          N
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \tau :\mathbb {N} \to \mathbb {N} }
  , 
  
    
      
        
          ∑
          
            n
            =
            0
          
          
            ∞
          
        
        
          f
          
            τ
            (
            n
            )
          
        
        (
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \sum _{n=0}^{\infty }f_{\tau (n)}(x)}
   is normally convergent to 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
  .

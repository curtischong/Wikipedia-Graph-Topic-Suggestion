This is a summary of differentiation rules, that is, rules for computing the derivative of a function in calculus.


== Elementary rules of differentiation ==
Unless otherwise stated, all functions are functions of real numbers (R) that return real values; although more generally, the formulae below apply wherever they are well defined — including the case of complex numbers (C).


=== Differentiation is linear ===
For any functions 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
   and 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   and any real numbers 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
   and 
  
    
      
        b
      
    
    {\displaystyle b}
  , the derivative of the function 
  
    
      
        h
        (
        x
        )
        =
        a
        f
        (
        x
        )
        +
        b
        g
        (
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle h(x)=af(x)+bg(x)}
   with respect to 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is

  
    
      
        
          h
          ′
        
        (
        x
        )
        =
        a
        
          f
          ′
        
        (
        x
        )
        +
        b
        
          g

        (
        x
        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle h'(x)=af'(x)+bg'(x).}
  In Leibniz's notation this is written as:

  
    
      
        
          
            
              d
              (

              +
              b
              g
              )
            
            
              d
              x

              d
              x
            
          
        
        +
        b
        
          
            
              d
              g
            
            
              d
              x
            
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\frac {d(af+bg)}{dx}}=a{\frac {df}{dx}}+b{\frac {dg}{dx}}.}
  Special cases include:

        (
        a

          )
          ′
        
        =
        a

    {\displaystyle (af)'=af'}
  The sum rule
  
    
      
        (
        f
        +
        g
        
          )
          ′
        
        =
        
          f
          ′
        
        +
        
          g
          ′
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle (f+g)'=f'+g'}
  The subtraction rule
  
    
      
        (
        f
        −
        g

        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle (f-g)'=f'-g'.}
  


=== The product rule ===

For the functions f and g, the derivative of the function h(x) = f(x) g(x) with respect to x is

  
    
      
        
          h
          ′
        
        (
        x
        )
        =
        (
        f
        g
        
          )
          ′

        (
        x
        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle h'(x)=(fg)'(x)=f'(x)g(x)+f(x)g'(x).}
  In Leibniz's notation this is written

  
    
      
        
          
            
              d
              (
              f
              g
              )

              x
            
          
        
        g
        +
        f
        
          
            
              d
              g
            
            
              d
              x
            
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\frac {d(fg)}{dx}}={\frac {df}{dx}}g+f{\frac {dg}{dx}}.}

        (
        x
        )
        =
        f

        x
        )
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle h(x)=f(g(x))}
   is

  
    
      
        
          h
          ′
        
        (
        x
        )

        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle h'(x)=f'(g(x))\cdot g'(x).}
  In Leibniz's notation, this is written as:

  Focusing on the notion of maps, and the differential being a map 
  
    
      
        
          D

=== The inverse function rule ===

If the function f has an inverse function g, meaning that 
  
    
      
        g
        (
        f
        (
        x
        )
        )
        =
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle g(f(x))=x}
  and 
  
    
      
        f
        (
        g
        (
        y
        )
        )
        =
        y
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(g(y))=y}
  , then

  
    
      
        
          g
          ′
        
        =
        
          
            1
            
              
                f
                ′
              
              ∘
              g
            
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle g'={\frac {1}{f'\circ g}}.}
  In Leibniz notation, this is written as

  
    
      
        
          
            
              d

        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\frac {dx}{dy}}={\frac {1}{\frac {dy}{dx}}}.}
  


== Power laws, polynomials, quotients, and reciprocals ==


=== The polynomial or elementary power rule ===

If 
  
    
      
        f
        (
        x
        )
        =
        
          x
          
            r
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(x)=x^{r}}
  , for any real number 
  
    
      
        r
        ≠
        0
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle r\neq 0,}
   then 

  
    
      
        
          f
          ′
        
        (
        x
        )
        =
        r
        
          x
          
            r
            −
            1
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle f'(x)=rx^{r-1}.}
  When 
  
    
      
        r
        =
        1
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle r=1,}
   this becomes the special case that if 
  
    
      
        f
        (
        x
        )
        =
        x
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(x)=x,}
   then 
  
    
      
        
          f
          ′
        
        (
        x
        )
        =
        1.
      
    
    {\displaystyle f'(x)=1.}
  
Combining the power rule with the sum and constant multiple rules permits the computation of the derivative of any polynomial.


=== The reciprocal rule ===

The derivative of 
  
    
      
        h
        (
        x

  The reciprocal rule can be derived either from the quotient rule, or from the combination of power rule and chain rule.


=== The quotient rule ===

If f and g are functions, then:

  
    
      
        
          
            (
            
              
                f
                g
              
            
            )
          
          ′
        
        =
        
          
            
              
                f
                ′
              
              g
              −
              
                g
                ′
              
              f
            
            
              g
              
                2
              
            
          
        
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \left({\frac {f}{g}}\right)'={\frac {f'g-g'f}{g^{2}}}\quad }
   wherever g is nonzero.This can be derived from the product rule and the reciprocal rule.


=== Generalized power rule ===

The elementary power rule generalizes considerably. The most general power rule is the functional power rule: for any functions f and g,

  
    
      
        (
        
          f
          
            g
          
        
        
          )
          ′
        
        =
        
          
            (
            
              e
              
                g
                ln
                ⁡
                f
              
            
            )
          
          ′
        
        =
        
          f
          
            g
          
        
        
          (
          
            
              f
              ′
            
            
              
                g
                f
              
            
            +
            
              g
              ′
            
            ln
            ⁡
            f
          
          )
        
        ,
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle (f^{g})'=\left(e^{g\ln f}\right)'=f^{g}\left(f'{g \over f}+g'\ln f\right),\quad }
  wherever both sides are well defined.Special cases

If 
  
    
      
        f
        (
        x
        )
        =
        
          x
          
            a
          
        
        
      
    
    {\textstyle f(x)=x^{a}\!}
  , then 
  
    
      
        
          f
          ′
        
        (
        x
        )
        =
        a
        
          x
          
            a
            −
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\textstyle f'(x)=ax^{a-1}}
  when a is any non-zero real number and x is positive.
The reciprocal rule may be derived as the special case where 
  
    
      
        g
        (
        x
        )
        =
        −
        1
        
      
    
    {\textstyle g(x)=-1\!}
  .

=== Logarithmic derivatives ===
The logarithmic derivative is another way of stating the rule for differentiating the logarithm of a function (using the chain rule):

  
    
      
        (
        ln
        ⁡
        f
        
          )
          ′
        
        =
        
          
            
              f
              ′
            
            f
          
        
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle (\ln f)'={\frac {f'}{f}}\quad }
   wherever f is positive.Logarithmic differentiation is a technique which uses logarithms and its differentiation rules to simplify certain expressions before actually applying the derivative.
Logarithms can be used to remove exponents, convert products into sums, and convert division into subtraction — each of which may lead to a simplified expression for taking derivatives.

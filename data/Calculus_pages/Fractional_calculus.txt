Fractional calculus is a branch of mathematical analysis that studies the several different possibilities of defining real number powers or complex number powers of the differentiation operator D

  
    
      
        D
        f
        (
        x
        )
        =
        
          
            d
            
              d
              x
            
          
        
        f
        (
        x
        )
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle Df(x)={\frac {d}{dx}}f(x)\,,}
  and of the integration operator J

  
    
      
        J
        f
        (
        x
        )
        =
        
          ∫
          
            0
          
          
            x
          
        
        f
        (
        s
        )
        
        d
        s
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle Jf(x)=\int _{0}^{x}f(s)\,ds\,,}
  and developing a calculus for such operators generalizing the classical one.
In this context, the term powers refers to iterative application of a linear operator D to a function f, that is, repeatedly composing D with itself, as in 
  
    
      
        
          D
          
            2
          
        
        (
        f
        )
        =
        (
        D
        ∘
        D
        )
        (
        f
        )
        =
        D
        (
        D
        (
        f
        )
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle D^{2}(f)=(D\circ D)(f)=D(D(f))}
  .
For example, one may ask for a meaningful interpretation of:

  
    
      
        
          
            D
          
        
        =
        
          D
          
            
              1
              2
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\sqrt {D}}=D^{\frac {1}{2}}}
  as an analogue of the functional square root for the differentiation operator, that is, an expression for some linear operator that when applied twice to any function will have the same effect as differentiation. More generally, one can look at the question of defining a linear functional

  
    
      
        
          D
          
            a
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle D^{a}}
  for every real-number a in such a way that, when a takes an integer value n ∈ ℤ, it coincides with the usual n-fold differentiation D if n > 0, and with the −nth power of J when n < 0.
One of the motivations behind the introduction and study of these sorts of extensions of the differentiation operator D is that the sets of operator powers { Da |a ∈ ℝ } defined in this way are continuous semigroups with parameter a, of which the original discrete semigroup of { Dn | n ∈ ℤ } for integer n is a denumerable subgroup: since continuous semigroups have a well developed mathematical theory, they can be applied to other branches of mathematics.
Fractional differential equations, also known as extraordinary differential equations, are a generalization of differential equations through the application of fractional calculus.


== Historical notes ==
In applied mathematics and mathematical analysis, fractional derivative is a derivative of any arbitrary order, real or complex. Its first appearance is in a letter written to Guillaume de l'Hôpital by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in 1695. As far as the existence of such a theory is concerned, the foundations of the subject were laid by Liouville in a paper from 1832.
The autodidact Oliver Heaviside introduced the practical use of fractional differential operators in electrical transmission line analysis circa 1890.


== Nature of the fractional derivative ==

The ath derivative of a function f (x) at a point x is a local property only when a is an integer; this is not the case for non-integer power derivatives. In other words, it is not correct to say that the fractional derivative at x of a function f (x) depends only on values of f very near x, in the way that integer-power derivatives certainly do. Therefore, it is expected that the theory involves some sort of boundary conditions, involving information on the function further out.The fractional derivative of a function to order a is often now defined by means of the Fourier or Mellin integral transforms.


== Heuristics ==
A fairly natural question to ask is whether there exists a linear operator H, or half-derivative, such that

  
    
      
        
          H
          
            2
          
        
        f
        (
        x
        )
        =
        D
        f
        (
        x
        )
        =
        
          
            
              d
              
                d
                x
              
            
          
        
        f
        (
        x
        )
        =
        
          f
          ′
        
        (
        x
        )
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle H^{2}f(x)=Df(x)={\dfrac {d}{dx}}f(x)=f'(x)\,.}
  It turns out that there is such an operator, and indeed for any a > 0, there exists an operator P such that

  
    
      
        
          (
          
            
              P
              
                a
              
            
            f
          
          )
        
        (
        x
        )
        =
        
          f
          ′
        
        (
        x
        )
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \left(P^{a}f\right)(x)=f'(x),}
  or to put it another way, the definition of dny/dxn can be extended to all real values of n.
Let f (x) be a function defined for x > 0. Form the definite integral from 0 to x. Call this

  
    
      
        (
        J
        f
        )
        (
        x
        )
        =
        
          ∫
          
            0
          
          
            x
          
        
        f
        (
        t
        )
        
        d
        t
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle (Jf)(x)=\int _{0}^{x}f(t)\,dt\,.}
  Repeating this process gives

    {\displaystyle \left(J^{2}f\right)(x)=\int _{0}^{x}(Jf)(t)\,dt=\int _{0}^{x}\left(\int _{0}^{t}f(s)\,ds\right)\,dt\,,}
  and this can be extended arbitrarily.
The Cauchy formula for repeated integration, namely

    {\displaystyle \left(J^{n}f\right)(x)={\frac {1}{(n-1)!}}\int _{0}^{x}\left(x-t\right)^{n-1}f(t)\,dt\,,}
  leads in a straightforward way to a generalization for real n.
Using the gamma function to remove the discrete nature of the factorial function gives us a natural candidate for fractional applications of the integral operator.

  
    
      
        
          (

            f
          
          )
        
        (
        x
        )
        =
        
          
            1
            
              Γ

          ∫
          
            0
          
          
            x

              x

              t
            
            )
          
          
            α
            −
            1

    {\displaystyle \left(J^{\alpha }f\right)(x)={\frac {1}{\Gamma (\alpha )}}\int _{0}^{x}\left(x-t\right)^{\alpha -1}f(t)\,dt\,.}
  This is in fact a well-defined operator.

    {\displaystyle \left(J^{\alpha }\right)\left(J^{\beta }f\right)(x)=\left(J^{\beta }\right)\left(J^{\alpha }f\right)(x)=\left(J^{\alpha +\beta }f\right)(x)={\frac {1}{\Gamma (\alpha +\beta )}}\int _{0}^{x}\left(x-t\right)^{\alpha +\beta -1}f(t)\,dt\,.}
  This relationship is called the semigroup property of fractional differintegral operators. Unfortunately the comparable process for the derivative operator D is significantly more complex, but it can be shown that D is neither commutative nor additive in general.

  For negative integer power k, the gamma function is undefined and we have to use the following relation:

  This extension of the above differential operator need not be constrained only to real powers. For example, the (1 + i)th derivative of the (1 − i)th derivative yields the 2nd derivative. Also setting negative values for a yields integrals.
For a general function f (x) and 0 < α < 1, the complete fractional derivative is

  For arbitrary α, since the gamma function is undefined for arguments whose real part is a negative integer and whose imaginary part is zero, it is necessary to apply the fractional derivative after the integer derivative has been performed. For example,

        )
        =

  which is what Cauchy gave us above.
Laplace transforms "work" on relatively few functions, but they are often useful for solving fractional differential equations.

=== Riemann–Liouville fractional integral ===
The classical form of fractional calculus is given by the Riemann–Liouville integral, which is essentially what has been described above. The theory for periodic functions (therefore including the 'boundary condition' of repeating after a period) is the Weyl integral. It is defined on Fourier series, and requires the constant Fourier coefficient to vanish (thus, it applies to functions on the unit circle whose integrals evaluate to 0). The Riemann-Liouville integral exists in two forms, upper and lower. Considering the interval [a,b], the integrals are defined as

            a

== Fractional derivatives ==
Unlike classical Newtonian derivatives, a fractional derivative is defined via a fractional integral.


=== Riemann–Liouville fractional derivative ===
The corresponding derivative is calculated using Lagrange's rule for differential operators. Computing nth order derivative over the integral of order (n − α), the α order derivative is obtained. It is important to remark that n is the smallest integer greater than α ( that is, n = ⌈α⌉). Similar to the definitions for the Riemann-Liouville integral, the derivative has upper and lower variants.

=== Caputo fractional derivative ===
Another option for computing fractional derivatives is the Caputo fractional derivative. It was introduced by Michele Caputo in his 1967 paper. In contrast to the Riemann-Liouville fractional derivative, when solving differential equations using Caputo's definition, it is not necessary to define the fractional order initial conditions. Caputo's definition is illustrated as follows.

  There is the Caputo fractional derivative defined as:

=== Atangana–Baleanu derivative ===
Like the integral, there is also a fractional derivative using the general Mittag-Leffler function as a kernel. The authors introduced two versions, the Atangana–Baleanu in Caputo sense (ABC) derivative, which is the convolution of a local derivative of a given function with the generalized Mittag-Leffler function, and the Atangana–Baleanu in Riemann–Liouville sense (ABR) derivative, which is the derivative of a convolution of a given function that is not differentiable with the generalized Mittag-Leffler function. The Atangana-Baleanu fractional derivative in Caputo sense is defined as:

  Even though the integral operator in question is a close resemblance of the famous Erdélyi–Kober operator, it is not possible to obtain the Hadamard fractional integral as a direct consequence of the Erdélyi–Kober operator. Also, there is a Katugampola-type fractional derivative, which generalizes the Riemann–Liouville and the Hadamard fractional derivatives. As with the case of fractional integrals, the same is not true for the Erdélyi–Kober operator.


== Functional calculus ==
In the context of functional analysis, functions f (D) more general than powers are studied in the functional calculus of spectral theory. The theory of pseudo-differential operators also allows one to consider powers of D. The operators arising are examples of singular integral operators; and the generalisation of the classical theory to higher dimensions is called the theory of Riesz potentials. So there are a number of contemporary theories available, within which fractional calculus can be discussed. See also Erdélyi–Kober operator, important in special function theory (Kober 1940), (Erdélyi 1950–51).

=== Fractional conservation of mass ===
As described by Wheatcraft and Meerschaert (2008), a fractional conservation of mass equation is needed to model fluid flow when the control volume is not large enough compared to the scale of heterogeneity and when the flux within the control volume is non-linear. In the referenced paper, the fractional conservation of mass equation for fluid flow is:

=== Groundwater flow problem ===
In 2013–2014 Atangana et al. described some groundwater flow problems using the concept of derivative with fractional order. In these works, The classical Darcy law is generalized by regarding the water flow as a function of a non-integer order derivative of the piezometric head. This generalized law and the law of conservation of mass are then used to derive a new equation for groundwater flow.


=== Fractional advection dispersion equation ===
This equation has been shown useful for modeling contaminant flow in heterogenous porous media.Atangana and Kilicman extended the fractional advection dispersion equation to a variable order equation. In their work, the hydrodynamic dispersion equation was generalized using the concept of a variational order derivative. The modified equation was numerically solved via the Crank–Nicolson method. The stability and convergence in numerical simulations showed that the modified equation is more reliable in predicting the movement of pollution in deformable aquifers than equations with constant fractional and integer derivatives


=== Time-space fractional diffusion equation models ===
Anomalous diffusion processes in complex media can be well characterized by using fractional-order diffusion equation models. The time derivative term is corresponding to long-time heavy tail decay and the spatial derivative for diffusion nonlocality. The time-space fractional diffusion governing equation can be written as

  A simple extension of fractional derivative is the variable-order fractional derivative, α and β are changed into α(x, t) and β(x, t). Its applications in anomalous diffusion modeling can be found in reference.


=== Structural damping models ===
Fractional derivatives are used to model viscoelastic damping in certain types of materials like polymers.

The propagation of acoustical waves in complex media, such as in biological tissue, commonly implies attenuation obeying a frequency power-law. This kind of phenomenon may be described using a causal wave equation which incorporates fractional time derivatives:

  See also Holm & Näsholm (2011) and the references therein. Such models are linked to the commonly recognized hypothesis that multiple relaxation phenomena give rise to the attenuation measured in complex media. This link is further described in Näsholm & Holm (2011b) and in the survey paper, as well as the acoustic attenuation article. See Holm & Nasholm (2013) for a paper which compares fractional wave equations which model power-law attenuation. This book on power-law attenuation also covers the topic in more detail.

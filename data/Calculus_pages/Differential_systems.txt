In mathematics, certain systems of partial differential equations are usefully formulated, from the point of view of their underlying geometric and algebraic structure, in terms of a system of differential forms. The idea is to take advantage of the way a differential form restricts to a submanifold, and the fact that this restriction is compatible with the exterior derivative. This is one possible approach to certain over-determined systems, for example, including Lax pairs of integrable systems. A Pfaffian system is specified by 1-forms alone, but the theory includes other types of example of differential system. To elaborate, a Pfaffian system is a set of 1-forms on a smooth manifold (which one sets equal to 0 to find solutions to the system).
Given a collection of differential 1-forms 
  
    
      
        
          
            α
            
              i
            
          
          ,
          i
          =

    {\displaystyle \textstyle \alpha _{i},i=1,2,\dots ,k}
   on an

    {\displaystyle \textstyle n}
  -dimensional manifold 
  
    
      
        M
      
    
    {\displaystyle M}
  ,  an integral manifold is an immersed (not necessarily embedded) submanifold whose tangent space at every point 
  
    
      
        
          p

          N
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \textstyle p\in N}
   is annihilated by (the pullback of) each 
  
    
      
        
          
            α
            
              i
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \textstyle \alpha _{i}}
  .
A maximal integral manifold is an immersed (not necessarily embedded) submanifold

  
    
      
        i
        :
        N
        ⊂
        M
      
    
    {\displaystyle i:N\subset M}
  such that the kernel of the restriction map on forms

  
    
      
        
          i
          
            ∗
          
        
        :
        
          Ω
          
            p
          
          
            1
          
        
        (
        M
        )
        →
        
          Ω
          
            p
          
          
            1
          
        
        (
        N
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle i^{*}:\Omega _{p}^{1}(M)\rightarrow \Omega _{p}^{1}(N)}
  is spanned by the 
  
    
      
        
          
            α
            
              i
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \textstyle \alpha _{i}}
   at every point 
  
    
      
        p
      
    
    {\displaystyle p}
   of 
  
    
      
        N
      
    
    {\displaystyle N}
  .  If in addition the 
  
    
      
        
          
            α

    {\displaystyle \textstyle \alpha _{i}}
   are linearly independent, then 
  
    
      
        N
      
    
    {\displaystyle N}
   is (
  
    
      
        n
        −
        k
      
    
    {\displaystyle n-k}
  )-dimensional.
A Pfaffian system is said to be completely integrable if 
  
    
      
        M
      
    
    {\displaystyle M}
   admits a foliation by maximal integral manifolds. (Note that the foliation need not be regular; i.e. the leaves of the foliation might not be embedded submanifolds.)
An integrability condition is a condition on the 
  
    
      
        
          α
          
            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha _{i}}
   to guarantee that there will be integral submanifolds of sufficiently high dimension.


== Necessary and sufficient conditions ==
The necessary and sufficient conditions for complete integrability of a Pfaffian system are given by the Frobenius theorem.  One version states that if the ideal 
  
    
      
        
          
            I
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {I}}}
   algebraically generated by the collection of αi inside the ring Ω(M) is differentially closed, in other words

  
    
      
        d
        
          
            I
          
        
        ⊂
        
          
            I
          
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle d{\mathcal {I}}\subset {\mathcal {I}},}
  then the system admits a foliation by maximal integral manifolds. (The converse is obvious from the definitions.)


== Example of a non-integrable system ==
Not every Pfaffian system  is completely integrable in the Frobenius sense. For example, consider the following one-form on R3 − (0,0,0):

  
    
      
        θ
        =
        z
        
        d
        x
        +
        x
        
        d
        y
        +
        y
        
        d
        z
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \theta =z\,dx+x\,dy+y\,dz.}
  If dθ were in the ideal generated by θ we would have, by the skewness of the wedge product

  
    
      
        θ
        ∧
        d
        θ
        =
        0.
      
    
    {\displaystyle \theta \wedge d\theta =0.}
  But a direct calculation gives

  
    
      
        θ
        ∧
        d
        θ
        =
        (
        x
        +
        y
        +
        z
        )
        
        d
        x
        ∧
        d
        y
        ∧
        d
        z
      
    
    {\displaystyle \theta \wedge d\theta =(x+y+z)\,dx\wedge dy\wedge dz}
  which is a nonzero multiple of the standard volume form on R3.  Therefore, there are no two-dimensional leaves, and the system is not completely integrable.
On the other hand, for the curve defined by

  
    
      
        x
        =
        t
        ,
        
        y
        =
        c
        ,
        
        z
        =
        
          e
          
            −
            t
            
              /
            
            c
          
        
        ,
        
        t
        >
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle x=t,\quad y=c,\qquad z=e^{-t/c},\quad t>0}
  then θ defined as above is 0, and hence the curve is easily verified to be a solution (i.e. an integral curve) for the above Pfaffian system for any nonzero constant c.


== Examples of applications ==
In Riemannian geometry, we may consider the problem of finding an orthogonal coframe θi,  i.e., a collection of 1-forms forming a basis of the cotangent space at every point with 
  
    
      
        ⟨
        
          θ
          
            i
          
        
        ,
        
          θ
          
            j
          
        
        ⟩
        =
        
          δ
          
            i
            j
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \langle \theta ^{i},\theta ^{j}\rangle =\delta ^{ij}}
   which are closed (dθi = 0, i = 1, 2, ..., n).  By the Poincaré lemma, the θi locally will have the form dxi for some functions xi on the manifold, and thus provide an isometry of an open subset of M with an open subset of Rn.  Such a manifold is called locally flat.
This problem reduces to a question on the coframe bundle of M.  Suppose we had such a closed coframe

  
    
      
        Θ
        =
        (
        
          θ
          
            1
          
        
        ,
        …
        ,
        
          θ
          
            n
          
        
        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Theta =(\theta ^{1},\dots ,\theta ^{n}).}
  If we had another coframe 
  
    
      
        Φ
        =
        (
        
          ϕ
          
            1
          
        
        ,
        …
        ,
        
          ϕ
          
            n
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Phi =(\phi ^{1},\dots ,\phi ^{n})}
  , then the two coframes would be related by an orthogonal transformation

  
    
      
        Φ
        =
        M
        Θ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Phi =M\Theta }
  If the connection 1-form is ω, then we have

  
    
      
        d
        Φ
        =
        ω
        ∧
        Φ
      
    
    {\displaystyle d\Phi =\omega \wedge \Phi }
  On the other hand,

  
    
      
        
          
            
              
                d
                Φ
              
              
                
                =
                (
                d
                M
                )
                ∧
                Θ
                +
                M
                ∧
                d
                Θ
              
            
            
              
              
                
                =
                (
                d
                M
                )
                ∧
                Θ
              
            
            
              
              
                
                =
                (
                d
                M
                )
                
                  M
                  
                    −
                    1
                  
                
                ∧
                Φ
                .
              
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}d\Phi &=(dM)\wedge \Theta +M\wedge d\Theta \\&=(dM)\wedge \Theta \\&=(dM)M^{-1}\wedge \Phi .\end{aligned}}}
  But 
  
    
      
        ω
        =
        (
        d
        M
        )
        
          M
          
            −
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \omega =(dM)M^{-1}}
   is the Maurer–Cartan form for the orthogonal group.  Therefore, it obeys the structural equation

  
    
      
        d
        ω
        +
        ω
        ∧
        ω
        =
        0
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle d\omega +\omega \wedge \omega =0,}
   and this is just the curvature of M: 
  
    
      
        Ω
        =
        d
        ω
        +
        ω
        ∧
        ω
        =
        0.
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Omega =d\omega +\omega \wedge \omega =0.}
  
After an application of the Frobenius theorem, one concludes that a manifold M is locally flat if and only if its curvature vanishes.


== Generalizations ==
Many generalizations exist to integrability conditions on differential systems which are not necessarily generated by one-forms.  The most famous of these are the Cartan–Kähler theorem, which only works for real analytic differential systems, and the Cartan–Kuranishi prolongation theorem.  See Further reading for details. The Newlander-Nirenberg theorem gives integrability conditions for an almost-complex structure.

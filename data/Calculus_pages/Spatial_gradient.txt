A spatial gradient is a gradient whose components are spatial derivatives, i.e., rate of change of a given scalar physical quantity with respect to the position coordinates. 
Homogeneous regions have spatial gradient vector norm equal to zero.
When evaluated over altitude or depth, it is called vertical gradient.
Examples:

BiologyConcentration gradient, the ratio of solute concentration between two adjoining regions
Potential gradient, the difference in electric charge between two adjoining regionsFluid dynamics and earth scienceDensity gradient

Temperature gradient
Geothermal gradient
Sound speed gradient
Wind gradient

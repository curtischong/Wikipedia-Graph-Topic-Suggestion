In mathematics, a Sobolev space is a vector space of functions equipped with a norm that is a combination of Lp-norms of the function together with its derivatives up to a given order. The derivatives are understood in a suitable weak sense to make the space complete, i.e. a Banach space. Intuitively, a Sobolev space is a space of functions possessing sufficiently many derivatives for some application domain, such as partial differential equations, and equipped with a norm that measures both the size and regularity of a function.
Sobolev spaces are named after the Russian mathematician Sergei Sobolev. Their importance comes from the fact that weak solutions of some important partial differential equations exist in appropriate Sobolev spaces, even when there are no strong solutions in spaces of continuous functions with the derivatives understood in the classical sense.

There are many criteria for smoothness of mathematical functions. The most basic criterion may be that of continuity. A stronger notion of smoothness is that of differentiability (because functions that are differentiable are also continuous) and a yet stronger notion of smoothness is that the derivative also be continuous (these functions are said to be of class C1 — see Differentiability classes). Differentiable functions are important in many areas, and in particular for differential equations. In the twentieth century, however, it was observed that the space C1 (or C2, etc.) was not exactly the right space to study solutions of differential equations. The Sobolev spaces are the modern replacement for these spaces in which to look for solutions of partial differential equations.
Quantities or properties of the underlying model of the differential equation are usually expressed in terms of integral norms, rather than the uniform norm. A typical example is measuring the energy of a temperature or velocity distribution by an L2-norm. It is therefore important to develop a tool for differentiating Lebesgue space functions.
The integration by parts formula yields that for every u ∈ Ck(Ω), where k is a natural number, and for all infinitely differentiable functions with compact support

  we call v the weak α-th partial derivative of u. If there exists a weak α-th partial derivative of u, then it is uniquely defined almost everywhere, and thus it is uniquely determined as an element of a Lebesgue space. On the other hand, if u ∈ Ck(Ω), then the classical and the weak derivative coincide. Thus, if v is a weak α-th partial derivative of u, we may denote it by Dαu := v.

              t
            
            )

    {\displaystyle \|f\|_{k,p}=\left(\sum _{i=0}^{k}\left\|f^{(i)}\right\|_{p}^{p}\right)^{\frac {1}{p}}=\left(\sum _{i=0}^{k}\int \left|f^{(i)}(t)\right|^{p}\,dt\right)^{\frac {1}{p}}.}

    {\displaystyle \|\cdot \|_{k,p},W^{k,p}}
   becomes a Banach space. It turns out that it is enough to take only the first and last in the sequence, i.e., the norm defined by

  
    
      
        
          
            ‖

    {\displaystyle \left\|f^{(k)}\right\|_{p}+\|f\|_{p}}
  is equivalent to the norm above (i.e. the induced topologies of the norms are the same).


==== The case p = 2 ====
Sobolev spaces with p = 2 are especially important because of their connection with Fourier series and because they form a Hilbert space. A special notation has arisen to cover this case, since the space is a Hilbert space:

  
    
      
        
          H
          
            k
          
        
        =
        
          W
          
            k
            ,
            2
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle H^{k}=W^{k,2}.}
  The space 
  
    
      
        
          H
          
            k
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle H^{k}}
   can be defined naturally in terms of Fourier series whose coefficients decay sufficiently rapidly, namely,

  
    
      
        
          H
          
            k
          
        
        (
        
          T
        
        )

    {\displaystyle H^{k}(\mathbb {T} )=\left\{f\in L^{2}(\mathbb {T} ):\sum _{n=-\infty }^{\infty }\left(1+n^{2}+n^{4}+\dots +n^{2k}\right)\left|{\widehat {f}}(n)\right|^{2}<\infty \right\}}
  where

          T
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {T} }
   denotes the 1-torus. As above, one can use the equivalent norm

  
    
      
        ‖
        f
        
          ‖
          
            k
            ,
            2
          
          
            2
          
        
        =
        
          ∑
          
            n
            =

              1
              +
              
                |
              
              n

            )

    {\displaystyle \|f\|_{k,2}^{2}=\sum _{n=-\infty }^{\infty }\left(1+|n|^{2}\right)^{k}\left|{\widehat {f}}(n)\right|^{2}.}
  Both representations follow easily from Parseval's theorem and the fact that differentiation is equivalent to multiplying the Fourier coefficient by in.
Furthermore, the space 
  
    
      
        
          H
          
            k
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle H^{k}}
   admits an inner product, like the space 
  
    
      
        
          H
          
            0
          
        
        =
        
          L

        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle H^{0}=L^{2}.}
   In fact, the 
  
    
      
        
          H
          
            k
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle H^{k}}
   inner product is defined in terms of the 
  
    
      
        
          L
          
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle L^{2}}
   inner product:

  
    
      
        ⟨
        u
        ,
        v

        =
        
          ∑
          
            i
            =
            0

        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \langle u,v\rangle _{H^{k}}=\sum _{i=0}^{k}\left\langle D^{i}u,D^{i}v\right\rangle _{L^{2}}.}
  The space 
  
    
      
        
          H
          
            k
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle H^{k}}
   becomes a Hilbert space with this inner product.


==== Other examples ====
Some other Sobolev spaces permit a simpler description. For example, 
  
    
      
        
          W
          
            1
            ,
            1
          
        
        (
        0
        ,
        1
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle W^{1,1}(0,1)}
   is the space of absolutely continuous functions on (0, 1) (or rather, equivalence classes of functions that are equal almost everywhere to such), while 
  
    
      
        
          W
          
            1
            ,
            ∞
          
        
        (
        I
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle W^{1,\infty }(I)}
   is the space of Lipschitz functions on I, for every interval I. All spaces 
  
    
      
        
          W
          
            k
            ,
            ∞
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle W^{k,\infty }}
   are (normed) algebras, i.e. the product of two elements is once again a function of this Sobolev space, which is not the case for 
  
    
      
        p
        <
        ∞
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle p<\infty .}
   (E.g., functions behaving like |x|−1/3 at the origin are in 
  
    
      
        
          L
          
            2
          
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle L^{2},}
   but the product of two such functions is not in 
  
    
      
        
          L
          
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle L^{2}}
  ).


=== Multidimensional case ===
The transition to multiple dimensions brings more difficulties, starting from the very definition. The requirement that 
  
    
      
        
          f
          
            (
            k
            −
            1
            )
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle f^{(k-1)}}
   be the integral of 
  
    
      
        
          f
          
            (
            k
            )
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle f^{(k)}}
   does not generalize, and the simplest solution is to consider derivatives in the sense of distribution theory.
A formal definition now follows. Let 
  
    
      
        k
        ∈
        
          N
        
        ,
        1
        ⩽
        p
        ⩽
        ∞

==== Approximation by smooth functions ====
It is rather hard to work with Sobolev spaces relying only on their definition. It is therefore interesting to know that by theorem of Meyers and Serrin a function 
  
    
      
        u
        ∈
        
          W
          
            k
            ,
            p
          
        
        (
        Ω
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle u\in W^{k,p}(\Omega )}
   can be approximated by smooth functions. This fact often allows us to translate properties of smooth functions to Sobolev functions. If 
  
    
      
        p
      
    
    {\displaystyle p}
   is finite and 
  
    
      
        Ω
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Omega }
   is open, then there exists for any 
  
    
      
        u
        ∈
        
          W
          
            k
            ,
            p
          
        
        (
        Ω
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle u\in W^{k,p}(\Omega )}
   an approximating sequence of functions 
  
    
      
        
          u
          
            m
          
        
        ∈
        
          C
          
            ∞
          
        
        (
        Ω
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle u_{m}\in C^{\infty }(\Omega )}
   such that:

  
    
      
        
          
            ‖
            
              
                u
                
                  m
                
              
              −
              u
            
            ‖
          
          
            
              W
              
                k
                ,
                p
              
            
            (
            Ω
            )
          
        
        →
        0.
      
    
    {\displaystyle \left\|u_{m}-u\right\|_{W^{k,p}(\Omega )}\to 0.}
  If 
  
    
      
        Ω
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Omega }
   has Lipschitz boundary, we may even assume that the 
  
    
      
        
          u
          
            m
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle u_{m}}
   are the restriction of smooth functions with compact support on all of 
  
    
      
        
          
            R
          
          
            n
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}.}
  


==== Examples ====
In higher dimensions, it is no longer true that, for example, 
  
    
      
        
          W
          
            1

            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle W^{1,1}}
   contains only continuous functions. For example, 
  
    
      
        
          |
        
        x

            −
            1
          
        
        ∈
        
          W
          
            1
            ,
            1
          
        
        (
        
          
            B
          
          
            3
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle |x|^{-1}\in W^{1,1}(\mathbb {B} ^{3})}
   where 
  
    
      
        
          
            B
          
          
            3
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {B} ^{3}}
   is the unit ball in three dimensions. For k > n/p the space 
  
    
      
        
          W
          
            k
            ,
            p
          
        
        (
        Ω
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle W^{k,p}(\Omega )}
   will contain only continuous functions, but for which k this is already true depends both on p and on the dimension. For example, as can be easily checked using spherical polar coordinates for the function 
  
    
      
        f
        :
        
          
            B
          
          
            n
          
        
        →
        
          R
        
        ∪
        {
        ∞
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle f:\mathbb {B} ^{n}\to \mathbb {R} \cup \{\infty \}}
   defined on the n-dimensional ball we have:

  
    
      
        f
        (
        x
        )
        =
        
          |
        
        x
        
          
            |
          
          
            −
            α
          
        
        ∈
        
          W
          
            k
            ,
            p
          
        
        (
        
          
            B
          
          
            n
          
        
        )
        ⟺
        α
        <
        
          
            
              n
              p
            
          
        
        −
        k
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(x)=|x|^{-\alpha }\in W^{k,p}(\mathbb {B} ^{n})\Longleftrightarrow \alpha <{\tfrac {n}{p}}-k.}
  Intuitively, the blow-up of f at 0 "counts for less" when n is large since the unit ball has "more outside and less inside" in higher dimensions.

   If a function is in

        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle W^{1,p}(\Omega ),}
   then, possibly after modifying the function on a set of measure zero, the restriction to almost every line parallel to the coordinate directions in 
  
    
      
        
          
            R
          
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}}
   is absolutely continuous; what's more, the classical derivative along the lines that are parallel to the coordinate directions are in 
  
    
      
        
          L
          
            p

        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle L^{p}(\Omega ).}
   Conversely, if the restriction of 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
   to almost every line parallel to the coordinate directions is absolutely continuous, then the pointwise gradient 
  
    
      
        ∇
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle \nabla f}
   exists almost everywhere, and 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
   is in 
  
    
      
        
          W
          
            1

            p
          
        
        (
        Ω
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle W^{1,p}(\Omega )}
   provided 
  
    
      
        f
        ,
        
          |

        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle f,|\nabla f|\in L^{p}(\Omega ).}
   In particular, in this case the weak partial derivatives of 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
   and pointwise partial derivatives of 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
   agree almost everywhere. The ACL characterization of the Sobolev spaces was established by Otto M. Nikodym (1933); see (Maz'ya 1985, §1.1.3).

== Traces ==

Sobolev spaces are often considered when investigating partial differential equations. It is essential to consider boundary values of Sobolev functions. If u ∈ C(Ω), those boundary values are described by the restriction 
  
    
      
        u
        
          
            |
          
          
            ∂
            Ω
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle u|_{\partial \Omega }}
  . However, it is not clear how to describe values at the boundary for u ∈ Wk,p(Ω), as the n-dimensional measure of the boundary is zero. The following theorem resolves the problem:

  Tu is called the trace of u. Roughly speaking, this theorem extends the restriction operator to the Sobolev space

Intuitively, taking the trace costs 1/p of a derivative. The functions u in W1,p(Ω) with zero trace, i.e. Tu = 0, can be characterized by the equality

== Extension operators ==
If 
  
    
      
        Ω
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Omega }
   is a domain whose boundary is not too poorly behaved (e.g., if its boundary is a manifold, or satisfies the more permissive "cone condition") then there is an operator A mapping functions of 
  
    
      
        Ω
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Omega }
   to functions of 
  
    
      
        
          
            R
          
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}}
   such that:

Au(x) = u(x) for almost every x in 
  
    
      
        Ω
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Omega }
   and

  
    
      
        A

    {\displaystyle A:W^{k,p}(\Omega )\to W^{k,p}(\mathbb {R} ^{n})}
   is continuous for any 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞ and integer k.We will call such an operator A an extension operator for 
  
    
      
        Ω

    {\displaystyle \Omega .}
  


=== Case of p = 2 ===
Extension operators are the most natural way to define 
  
    
      
        
          H
          
            s
          
        
        (
        Ω
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle H^{s}(\Omega )}
   for non-integer s (we cannot work directly on 
  
    
      
        Ω
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Omega }
   since taking Fourier transform is a global operation). We define 
  
    
      
        
          H
          
            s
          
        
        (
        Ω
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle H^{s}(\Omega )}
   by saying that 
  
    
      
        u
        ∈
        
          H
          
            s
          
        
        (
        Ω
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle u\in H^{s}(\Omega )}
   if and only if 
  
    
      
        A
        u
        ∈
        
          H
          
            s
          
        
        (
        
          
            R
          
          
            n
          
        
        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle Au\in H^{s}(\mathbb {R} ^{n}).}
   Equivalently, complex interpolation yields the same 
  
    
      
        
          H
          
            s
          
        
        (
        Ω
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle H^{s}(\Omega )}
   spaces so long as 
  
    
      
        Ω
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Omega }
   has an extension operator. If 
  
    
      
        Ω
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Omega }
   does not have an extension operator, complex interpolation is the only way to obtain the 
  
    
      
        
          H
          
            s
          
        
        (
        Ω
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle H^{s}(\Omega )}
   spaces.
As a result, the interpolation inequality still holds.


=== Extension by zero ===
Like above, we define 
  
    
      
        
          H
          
            0

== Sobolev embeddings ==

It is a natural question to ask if a Sobolev function is continuous or even continuously differentiable. Roughly speaking, sufficiently many weak derivatives or large p result in a classical derivative. This idea is generalized and made precise in the Sobolev embedding theorem.

   then

    {\displaystyle W^{k,p}\subseteq W^{m,q}}
  and the embedding is continuous. Moreover, if

    {\displaystyle k-{\tfrac {n}{p}}>m-{\tfrac {n}{q}}}
   then the embedding is completely continuous (this is sometimes called Kondrachov's theorem or the Rellich-Kondrachov theorem). Functions in 
  
    
      
        
          W

            ∞
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle W^{m,\infty }}
   have all derivatives of order less than m continuous, so in particular this gives conditions on Sobolev spaces for various derivatives to be continuous. Informally these embeddings say that to convert an Lp estimate to a boundedness estimate costs 1/p derivatives per dimension.
There are similar variations of the embedding theorem for non-compact manifolds such as 
  
    
      
        
          
            R
          
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}}
   (Stein 1970). Sobolev embeddings on 
  
    
      
        
          
            R
          
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}}
   that are not compact often have a related, but weaker,  property of cocompactness.

In mathematics, convergence tests are methods of testing for the convergence, conditional convergence, absolute convergence, interval of convergence or divergence of an infinite series 
  
    
      
        
          ∑
          
            n
            =
            1
          
          
            ∞
          
        
        
          a
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \sum _{n=1}^{\infty }a_{n}}
  .


== List of tests ==


=== Limit of the summand ===
If the limit of the summand is undefined or nonzero, that is 
  
    
      
        
          lim
          
            n
            →
            ∞
          
        
        
          a
          
            n
          
        
        ≠
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lim _{n\to \infty }a_{n}\neq 0}
  , then the series must diverge. In this sense, the partial sums are Cauchy only if this limit exists and is equal to zero. The test is inconclusive if the limit of the summand is zero.


=== Ratio test ===
This is also known as D'Alembert's criterion.

Suppose that there exists 
  
    
      
        r
      
    
    {\displaystyle r}
   such that

  
    
      
        
          lim
          
            n
            →
            ∞
          
        
        
          |
          
            
              
                a
                
                  n
                  +
                  1
                
              
              
                a
                
                  n
                
              
            
          
          |
        
        =
        r
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lim _{n\to \infty }\left|{\frac {a_{n+1}}{a_{n}}}\right|=r.}
  
If r < 1, then the series is absolutely convergent. If r > 1, then the series diverges. If r = 1, the ratio test is inconclusive, and the series may converge.


=== Root test ===
This is also known as the nth root test or Cauchy's criterion.

Let

  
    
      
        r
        =
        
          lim sup
          
            n
            →
            ∞
          
        
        
          
            
              
                |
              
              
                a
                
                  n
                
              
              
                |
              
            
            
              n
            
          
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle r=\limsup _{n\to \infty }{\sqrt[{n}]{|a_{n}|}},}
  
where 
  
    
      
        lim sup
      
    
    {\displaystyle \limsup }
   denotes the limit superior (possibly 
  
    
      
        ∞
      
    
    {\displaystyle \infty }
  ; if the limit exists it is the same value).
If r < 1, then the series converges. If r > 1, then the series diverges. If r = 1, the root test is inconclusive, and the series may converge or diverge.The root test is stronger than the ratio test: whenever the ratio test determines the convergence or divergence of an infinite series, the root test does too, but not conversely.For example, for the series

1 + 1 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.125 + 0.125 + ... = 4convergence follows from the root test but not from the ratio test.


=== Integral test ===
The series can be compared to an integral to establish convergence or divergence. Let 
  
    
      
        f
        :
        [
        1
        ,
        ∞
        )
        →
        
          
            R
          
          
            +
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle f:[1,\infty )\to \mathbb {R} _{+}}
   be a non-negative and monotonically decreasing function such that 
  
    
      
        f
        (
        n
        )
        =
        
          a
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(n)=a_{n}}
  .

If

  
    
      
        
          ∫
          
            1
          
          
            ∞
          
        
        f
        (
        x
        )
        
        d
        x
        =
        
          lim
          
            t
            →
            ∞
          
        
        
          ∫
          
            1
          
          
            t
          
        
        f
        (
        x
        )
        
        d
        x
        <
        ∞
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \int _{1}^{\infty }f(x)\,dx=\lim _{t\to \infty }\int _{1}^{t}f(x)\,dx<\infty ,}
  
then the series converges. But if the integral diverges, then the series does so as well.
In other words, the series 
  
    
      
        
          
            a
            
              n
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {a_{n}}}
   converges if and only if the integral converges.


=== Direct comparison test ===
If the series 
  
    
      
        
          ∑
          
            n
            =
            1
          
          
            ∞
          
        
        
          b
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \sum _{n=1}^{\infty }b_{n}}
   is an absolutely convergent series and 
  
    
      
        
          |
        
        
          a
          
            n
          
        
        
          |
        
        ≤
        
          |
        
        
          b
          
            n
          
        
        
          |
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle |a_{n}|\leq |b_{n}|}
   for sufficiently large n , then the series 
  
    
      
        
          ∑
          
            n
            =
            1
          
          
            ∞
          
        
        
          a
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \sum _{n=1}^{\infty }a_{n}}
   converges absolutely.


=== Limit comparison test ===
If 
  
    
      
        {
        
          a

        }
        ,
        {

        }
        >
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle \{a_{n}\},\{b_{n}\}>0}
  , (that is, each element of the two sequences is positive) and the limit 
  
    
      
        
          lim
          
            n
            →
            ∞
          
        
        
          
            
              a

                n
              
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lim _{n\to \infty }{\frac {a_{n}}{b_{n}}}}
   exists, is finite and non-zero, then 
  
    
      
        
          ∑
          
            n
            =
            1

            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \sum _{n=1}^{\infty }a_{n}}
   converges if and only if 
  
    
      
        
          ∑
          
            n
            =

            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \sum _{n=1}^{\infty }b_{n}}
   converges.


=== Cauchy condensation test ===
Let 
  
    
      
        
          {
          
            a

          }
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \left\{a_{n}\right\}}

    {\displaystyle A=\sum _{n=1}^{\infty }a_{n}}
   converges if and only if the sum 
  
    
      
        
          A
          
            ∗
          
        
        =
        
          ∑

            0
          
          
            ∞
          
        
        
          2

    {\displaystyle A^{*}=\sum _{n=0}^{\infty }2^{n}a_{2^{n}}}
   converges. Moreover, if they converge, then 
  
    
      
        A
        ≤
        
          A

        ≤
        2
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle A\leq A^{*}\leq 2A}
   holds.


=== Abel's test ===
Suppose the following statements are true:

  
    
      
        ∑
        
          a

            {

                n
              
            
            }
          
          
            n
            =
            1
          
          
            ∞
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \left\{a_{n}\right\}_{n=1}^{\infty }}
   be a sequence of positive numbers. Then the infinite product 
  
    
      
        
          ∏
          
            n
            =
            1
          
          
            ∞
          
        
        (
        1

    {\displaystyle \prod _{n=1}^{\infty }(1+a_{n})}
   converges if and only if the series 
  
    
      
        
          ∑
          
            n

    {\displaystyle 0<a_{n}<1}

          ∏

    {\displaystyle \prod _{n=1}^{\infty }(1-a_{n})}
   approaches a non-zero limit if and only if the series 
  
    
      
        
          ∑
          
            n

    {\displaystyle \sum _{n=1}^{\infty }a_{n}}
   converges .
This can be proved by taking the logarithm of the product and using limit comparison test.

Adrian Stephen Lewis (born 1962 in England) is a British-Canadian mathematician, specializing in variational analysis and nonsmooth optimization.


== Education and career ==
At the University of Cambridge he graduated with B.A. in mathematics in 1983, M.A. in 1987, and Ph.D. in engineering in 1987. His doctoral dissertation is entitled Extreme point methods for infinite linear programming. Lewis was a postdoc at Dalhousie University. In Canada he was a faculty member at the University of Waterloo from 1989 to 2001 and at Simon Fraser University from 2001 to 2004. At Cornell University he is since 2004 a full professor and since 2018 the Samuel B. Eckert Professor of Engineering in the School of Operations Research and Information Engineering. From 2010 to 2013 he served as the School's director.Lewis has held visiting appointments at academic institutions in France, Italy, New Zealand, the United States, and Spain.
He is a co-editor for Mathematical Programming, Series A and an associate editor for Set-Valued and Variational Analysis and for Mathematika. He has been a member of the  editorial boards of Mathematics of Operations Research, the SIAM Journal on Optimization, the SIAM Journal on Matrix Analysis and Applications, the SIAM Journal on Control and Optimization, and the MPS/SIAM Series on Optimization.Much of his research deals with "semi-algebraic optimization and variational properties of eigenvalues." With Jonathan Borwein he co-authored the book Convex Analysis and Nonlinear Optimization (2000, 2nd edition 2006).Lewis holds British and Canadian citizenship and permanent residency in the USA.
